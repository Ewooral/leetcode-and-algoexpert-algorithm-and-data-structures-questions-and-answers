    "### Dynamic Programming and Recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is basically, recursion plus using common sense. What it means is that recursion allows you to express the value of a function in terms of other values of that function. Where the common sense tells you that if you implement your function in a way that the recursive calls are done in advance, and stored for easy access, it will make your program faster. This is what we call `Memoization` - it is `memorizing` the results of some specific states, which can then be later accessed to solve other sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind dynamic programming is that we trade space for time, i.e. to say that instead of\n",
    "calculating all the states taking a lot of time but no space, we take up space to store the results of all\n",
    "the sub-problems to save time later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand this by taking an example of Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci (n) = 1; if n = 0\n",
    "Fibonacci (n) = 1; if n = 1\n",
    "Fibonacci (n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the first few numbers in this series will be: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... and so on!\n",
