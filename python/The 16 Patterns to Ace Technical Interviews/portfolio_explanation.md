##    Data Munging
    . I was tasked with collecting metrics on a plethora(excess) of disparate(different) shipping data
    . The data was contained in a number of different spreadsheets, each with its own competing schema.
    . In order to interrogate the data, all of it has to be in the same place and in the same format. 

    . In order to combine the spreadsheets:
    . Reads each row from the spreadsheets.
    . Extracts the relevant data.
    . Munges it into a format that fits the database schema.
    . nserts the data into the database.
    . Spreadsheet 0 is self contained and can simply be inserted into the database, 
      but spreadsheets 1 and 2 are dependent on one another. Spreadsheet 1 contains 
      a single product per row, you will need to combine each row based on its shipping identifier, 
      determine the quantity of goods in the shipment, and add a new row to the database for each 
      product in the shipment. The origin and destination for each shipment in spreadsheet 1 are contained 
      in spreadsheet 2. You may assume that all the given data is valid - product names are always 
      spelled the same way, quantities are positive, etc. When you’re finished, convert the python script  
      you used to populate the database into a PDF and submit it below. 

###   Heap Data Structure
      The Walmart Shipping Department is implementing a new system which  
      depends on a **priority queue**

      PRIORITY QUEUE is used in prim's algorithm. It is used in data compression techniques like Huffman code. 
      It is used in heap sort. It is also used in operating system like priority scheduling, 
      load balancing and interrupt handling.

      Since the queue represents a potential
      bottleneck in the system, much thought is being put into selecting the 
      right data structure for the job. Many options have been proposed, and 
      the plan is to benchmark each one in order to pick the best option. 
      Your task is to implement one of the proposed data structures: a slightly 
      modified heap. 

### JPMORGAN
    I was tasked to add a chart to a trader’s dashboard allowing 
    them to better identify under/over-valued stocks.
    The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able
    to visualize when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally
    more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy
    to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. 
    Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.

    2. Fix the broken client datafeed script in the repository by making the required adjustments to it.
    3. Generate a patch file of the changes you made
    4. Bonus task: Add unit tests in the test script in the repository.
