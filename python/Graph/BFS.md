# Breadth-first search
    We looked at a search algorithm in chapter 
    1: binary search. 
    Breadth first search is a different kind of search algorithm: 
    one that runs on graphs. 

## It can help answer two types of questions:
    
    • Question type 1: Is there a path from node A to node B?
    • Question type 2: What is the shortest path from node A to node B?

### Breadth-first search NOT ONLY finds a 
    
* path from A to B, 
* it also finds the shortest path.


    Notice that this only works if you search people in the same order in 
    which they’re added
