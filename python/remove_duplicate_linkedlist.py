REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM LINKED LIST

You're given the head of a singly linked list whose nodes are in sorted order
with respect to their values. Write a function that returns a modified version of the
Linked list that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values.
The linked list should be modified in place(i.e. you shouldn't create
a brand new list), and the modified list should still have its nodes sorted with respect to
their values. 

Each Linked list node has an interger VALUE as well as a NODE pointer NEXT 
pointing to the next node in the linked list or NULL/None if there are no more nodes.
