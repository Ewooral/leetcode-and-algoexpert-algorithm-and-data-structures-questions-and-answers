""" 
Write a function that takes in a positive integer "NumberOfTags" 
and returns a list of all the valid strings that can generate with 
that number of matched "<div></div>" tags. 
A string is valid and conains matched <div></div> tags if for every
opening tag <div>, there's a closing tag </div> that comes after the 
opening tag and that isn't used as a closing tag for another opening
tag. Each output string should contain exacly numberOfTags opening tags 
and numberOfTags closing tags. 

E.g. given numberOfTags = 2, the valid strings to return would be:
["<div></div><div></div>", 
"<div><div></div></div>"]
