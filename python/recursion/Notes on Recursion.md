# Recursion 
  It is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on the solution to the similar instance of the same problem.


# When to use Recursion
  1. When we can easily break down a problem into similar subproblems
  2. When we are fine with extra overhead(when time and space complexity isn't much of a concern)
  3. When we need a quick working solution instead of efficient one 
  4. When we traverse a tree.
  5. When we use Memoization in recursion to improve complexity
  6. works well with json objects, trees, graphs

# When to avoid Recursion
  1. If time and space complexities are a priority
  2. Recursion uses more memory.
  3. Recursion can slow down our algorithm.

 
# Recursion contains the ff steps
  1. setting the recursive call
  2. setting the base case
