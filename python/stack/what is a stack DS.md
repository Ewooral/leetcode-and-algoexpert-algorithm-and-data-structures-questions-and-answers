# A stack: can be explained as a pile of objects stack vertically.The stack data structure stores items in a last in first out manner (LIFO).   
    E.g. pile of dinner plates, books and the back button in a web browser.
    
# Operations performed on a stack are: 
    1. Pop() removes the first element in the stack
    2. Push()
    inserts an element in a stack
    3. Peek() displays the last element(top element) in a stack.
    4. isEmpty() checks if a stack is empty
    5. isFull() checks if a stack is full
    6. delete()

# creating a stack using a List
    - Easy to implement
    - Speed problem when the list grows

# creating stack using Linked list
    - Fast performance
    - implementation is not easy

# When to use Stack?
    - When we are implementing a LIFO functionality
    - data corruption is minimun

# When to avoid Stack?
    - Random access is not possible
