    "# 41 Questions to Test your Knowledge of Python Strings\n",
    "How to crush algorithm questions by mastering string fundamentals\n",
    "Photo by ThisisEngineering RAEng on Unsplash\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve started tracking the most commonly used functions while doing algorithm questions on LeetCode and HackerRank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a good engineer isn’t about memorizing a language’s functions, but that doesn’t mean it’s not helpful. Particularly in interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my string cheatsheet converted into a list of questions to quiz myself. While these are not interview questions, mastering these will help you solve live coding questions with greater ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "How well do you know Python strings?\n",
    "1. How would you confirm that 2 strings have the same identity?\n",
    "\n",
    "The is operator returns True if 2 names point to the same location in memory. This is what we’re referring to when we talk about identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t confuse is with ==, the latter which only tests equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "animals           = ['python','gopher']\n",
    "more_animals      = animalsprint(animals == more_animals) #=> True\n",
    "print(animals is more_animals) #=> Trueeven_more_animals = ['python','gopher']print(animals == even_more_animals) #=> True\n",
    "print(animals is even_more_animals) #=> False\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice above how animals and even_more_animals have a different identity even though they are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the id() function returns the id of a memory address associated with a name. Two objects with the same identity will return the same id.\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'object'\n",
    "id(name)\n",
    "#=> 4408718312\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How would you check if each word in a string begins with a capital letter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The istitle() function checks if each word is capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "print( 'The Hilton'.istitle() ) #=> True\n",
    "print( 'The dog'.istitle() ) #=> False\n",
    "print( 'sticky rice'.istitle() ) #=> False\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check if a string contains a specific substring\n",
    "\n",
    "The in operator will return True if a string contains a substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "print( 'plane' in 'The worlds fastest plane' ) #=> True\n",
    "print( 'car' in 'The worlds fastest plane' ) #=> False\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 different functions that will return the starting index, find() and index(). They have slightly different behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "find() returns -1 if the substring is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "'The worlds fastest plane'.find('plane') #=> 19\n",
    "'The worlds fastest plane'.find('car') #=> -1\n",
    "\n",
    "index() will throw a ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "'The worlds fastest plane'.index('plane') #=> 19\n",
    "'The worlds fastest plane'.index('car') #=> ValueError: substring not found\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Count the total number of characters in a string\n",
    "\n",
    "len() will return the length of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "len('The first president of the organization..') #=> 19\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Count the number of a specific character in a string\n",
    "\n",
    "count() will return the number of occurrences of a specific character.\n",
    "\n",
    "'The first president of the organization..'.count('o') #=> 3\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Capitalize the first character of a string\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the capitalize() function to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "'florida dolphins'.capitalize() #=> 'Florida dolphins'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is an f-string and how do you use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "New in python 3.6, f-strings make string interpolation really easy. Using f-strings is similar to using format().\n",
    "\n",
    "F-strings are denoted by an f before the opening quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'Chris'\n",
    "food = 'creme brulee'f'Hello. My name is {name} and I like {food}.'\n",
    "#=> 'Hello. My name is Chris and I like creme brulee'\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Search a specific part of a string for a substring\n",
    "\n",
    "index() can also be provided with optional start and end indices for searching within a larger string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'the happiest person in the whole wide world.'.index('the',10,44)\n",
    "#=> 23\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the above returned 23 rather than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "'the happiest person in the whole wide world.'.index('the')\n",
    "#=> 0\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Interpolate a variable into a string using format()\n",
    "\n",
    "format() is similar to using an f-string. Though in my opinion, it’s less user friendly because variables are all passed in at the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "difficulty = 'easy'\n",
    "thing = 'exam''That {} was {}!'.format(thing, difficulty)\n",
    "#=> 'That exam was easy!'\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Check if a string contains only numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "isnumeric() returns True if all characters are numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "'80000'.isnumeric() #=> True\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that punctuation is not numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "'1.0'.isnumeric() #=> False\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Split a string on a specific character\n",
    "\n",
    "The split() function will split a string on a given character or characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "'This is great'.split(' ')\n",
    "#=> ['This', 'is', 'great']'not--so--great'.split('--')\n",
    "#=> ['not', 'so', 'great']\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Check if a string is composed of all lower case characters\n",
    "\n",
    "islower() returns True only if all characters in a string are lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "'all lower case'.islower() #=> True\n",
    "'not aLL lowercase'.islower() # False\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Check if the first character in a string is lowercase\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by calling the previously mentioned function on the first index of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'aPPLE'[0].islower() #=> True\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Can an integer be added to a string in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In some languages this can be done but python will throw a TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Ten' + 10 #=> TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Reverse the string “hello world”\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the string into a list of characters, reverse the list, then rejoin into a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "''.join(reversed(\"hello world\"))\n",
    "#=> 'dlrow olleh'\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Join a list of strings into a single string, delimited by hyphens\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s join() function can join characters in a list with a given character inserted between every element.\n",
    "\n",
    "'-'.join(['a','b','c'])\n",
    "#=> 'a-b-c'\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Check if all characters in a string conform to ASCII\n",
    "\n",
    "The isascii() function returns True if all characters in a string are included in ASCII.\n",
    "\n",
    "print( 'Â'.isascii() ) #=> False\n",
    "print( 'A'.isascii() ) #=> True\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Uppercase or lowercase an entire string\n",
    "\n",
    "upper() and lower() return strings in all upper and lower cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "sentence = 'The Cat in the Hat'sentence.upper() #=> 'THE CAT IN THE HAT'\n",
    "sentence.lower() #=> 'the cat in the hat'\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Uppercase first and last character of a string\n",
    "\n",
    "As in a past example, we’ll target specific indices of the string. Strings aren’t mutable in Python so we’ll build an entirely new string.\n",
    "\n",
    "animal = 'fish'animal[0].upper() + animal[1:-1] + animal[-1].upper()\n",
    "#=> 'FisH'\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Check if a string is all uppercase\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to islower(), isupper() returns True only if the whole string is capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Toronto'.isupper() #=> False\n",
    "'TORONTO'.isupper() #= True\n",
    "\n",
    "22. When would you use splitlines()?\n",
    "\n",
    "splitlines() splits a string on line breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "sentence = \"It was a stormy night\\nThe house creeked\\nThe wind blew.\"sentence.splitlines()\n",
    "#=> ['It was a stormy night', 'The house creeked', 'The wind blew.']\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Give an example of string slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing a string takes up to 3 arguments, string[start_index:end_index:step].\n",
    "\n",
    "step is the interval at which characters should be returned. So a step of 3 would return the character at every 3rd index.\n",
    "\n",
    "string = 'I like to eat apples'string[:6] #=> 'I like'\n",
    "string[7:13] #=> 'to eat'\n",
    "string[0:-1:2] #=> 'Ilk oetape' (every 2nd character)\n",

    "#=> 'Sally sells mountain shells by the mountain shore'\n",
    "\n",
    "27. Return the minimum character in a string\n",

    "37. What does it mean for strings to be immutable in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a string object has been created, it cannot be changed. “Modifying” that string creates a whole new object in memory.\n",
