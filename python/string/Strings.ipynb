    "# 41 Questions to Test your Knowledge of Python Strings\n",
    "How to crush algorithm questions by mastering string fundamentals\n",
    "Photo by ThisisEngineering RAEng on Unsplash\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve started tracking the most commonly used functions while doing algorithm questions on LeetCode and HackerRank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a good engineer isn’t about memorizing a language’s functions, but that doesn’t mean it’s not helpful. Particularly in interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my string cheatsheet converted into a list of questions to quiz myself. While these are not interview questions, mastering these will help you solve live coding questions with greater ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "How well do you know Python strings?\n",
    "1. How would you confirm that 2 strings have the same identity?\n",
    "\n",
    "The is operator returns True if 2 names point to the same location in memory. This is what we’re referring to when we talk about identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t confuse is with ==, the latter which only tests equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "animals           = ['python','gopher']\n",
    "more_animals      = animalsprint(animals == more_animals) #=> True\n",
    "print(animals is more_animals) #=> Trueeven_more_animals = ['python','gopher']print(animals == even_more_animals) #=> True\n",
    "print(animals is even_more_animals) #=> False\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice above how animals and even_more_animals have a different identity even though they are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the id() function returns the id of a memory address associated with a name. Two objects with the same identity will return the same id.\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'object'\n",
    "id(name)\n",
    "#=> 4408718312\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How would you check if each word in a string begins with a capital letter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The istitle() function checks if each word is capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "print( 'The Hilton'.istitle() ) #=> True\n",
    "print( 'The dog'.istitle() ) #=> False\n",
    "print( 'sticky rice'.istitle() ) #=> False\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check if a string contains a specific substring\n",
    "\n",
    "The in operator will return True if a string contains a substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "print( 'plane' in 'The worlds fastest plane' ) #=> True\n",
    "print( 'car' in 'The worlds fastest plane' ) #=> False\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 different functions that will return the starting index, find() and index(). They have slightly different behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "find() returns -1 if the substring is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "'The worlds fastest plane'.find('plane') #=> 19\n",
    "'The worlds fastest plane'.find('car') #=> -1\n",
    "\n",
    "index() will throw a ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "'The worlds fastest plane'.index('plane') #=> 19\n",
    "'The worlds fastest plane'.index('car') #=> ValueError: substring not found\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Count the total number of characters in a string\n",
    "\n",
    "len() will return the length of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "len('The first president of the organization..') #=> 19\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Count the number of a specific character in a string\n",
    "\n",
    "count() will return the number of occurrences of a specific character.\n",
    "\n",
    "'The first president of the organization..'.count('o') #=> 3\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Capitalize the first character of a string\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the capitalize() function to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "'florida dolphins'.capitalize() #=> 'Florida dolphins'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is an f-string and how do you use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "New in python 3.6, f-strings make string interpolation really easy. Using f-strings is similar to using format().\n",
    "\n",
    "F-strings are denoted by an f before the opening quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'Chris'\n",
    "food = 'creme brulee'f'Hello. My name is {name} and I like {food}.'\n",
    "#=> 'Hello. My name is Chris and I like creme brulee'\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Search a specific part of a string for a substring\n",
    "\n",
    "index() can also be provided with optional start and end indices for searching within a larger string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'the happiest person in the whole wide world.'.index('the',10,44)\n",
    "#=> 23\n",

    "Notice how the above returned 23 rather than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "'the happiest person in the whole wide world.'.index('the')\n",
    "#=> 0\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Interpolate a variable into a string using format()\n",
    "\n",
    "format() is similar to using an f-string. Though in my opinion, it’s less user friendly because variables are all passed in at the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "difficulty = 'easy'\n",
    "thing = 'exam''That {} was {}!'.format(thing, difficulty)\n",
    "#=> 'That exam was easy!'\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Check if a string contains only numbers\n",

    "isnumeric() returns True if all characters are numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "'80000'.isnumeric() #=> True\n",

    "Note that punctuation is not numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "'1.0'.isnumeric() #=> False\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Split a string on a specific character\n",
    "\n",
    "The split() function will split a string on a given character or characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "'This is great'.split(' ')\n",
    "#=> ['This', 'is', 'great']'not--so--great'.split('--')\n",
    "#=> ['not', 'so', 'great']\n",

    "\n",
    "'all lower case'.islower() #=> True\n",
    "'not aLL lowercase'.islower() # False\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Check if the first character in a string is lowercase\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by calling the previously mentioned function on the first index of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'aPPLE'[0].islower() #=> True\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Can an integer be added to a string in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In some languages this can be done but python will throw a TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Ten' + 10 #=> TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Reverse the string “hello world”\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the string into a list of characters, reverse the list, then rejoin into a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "''.join(reversed(\"hello world\"))\n",
    "#=> 'dlrow olleh'\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Join a list of strings into a single string, delimited by hyphens\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s join() function can join characters in a list with a given character inserted between every element.\n",

    "#=> 'a-b-c'\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Check if all characters in a string conform to ASCII\n",
    "\n",
    "The isascii() function returns True if all characters in a string are included in ASCII.\n",
    "\n",
    "print( 'Â'.isascii() ) #=> False\n",
    "print( 'A'.isascii() ) #=> True\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Uppercase or lowercase an entire string\n",
    "\n",
    "upper() and lower() return strings in all upper and lower cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "sentence = 'The Cat in the Hat'sentence.upper() #=> 'THE CAT IN THE HAT'\n",
    "sentence.lower() #=> 'the cat in the hat'\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Uppercase first and last character of a string\n",
    "\n",
    "As in a past example, we’ll target specific indices of the string. Strings aren’t mutable in Python so we’ll build an entirely new string.\n",
    "\n",
    "animal = 'fish'animal[0].upper() + animal[1:-1] + animal[-1].upper()\n",
    "#=> 'FisH'\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Check if a string is all uppercase\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to islower(), isupper() returns True only if the whole string is capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Toronto'.isupper() #=> False\n",
    "'TORONTO'.isupper() #= True\n",
    "\n",
    "22. When would you use splitlines()?\n",
    "\n",
    "splitlines() splits a string on line breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "sentence = \"It was a stormy night\\nThe house creeked\\nThe wind blew.\"sentence.splitlines()\n",
    "#=> ['It was a stormy night', 'The house creeked', 'The wind blew.']\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Give an example of string slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing a string takes up to 3 arguments, string[start_index:end_index:step].\n",
    "\n",
    "step is the interval at which characters should be returned. So a step of 3 would return the character at every 3rd index.\n",
    "\n",
    "string = 'I like to eat apples'string[:6] #=> 'I like'\n",
    "string[7:13] #=> 'to eat'\n",

    "## Approach 1: Check All Indices Using a Hash Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "    Definition: a valid substring is a string that is a concatenation of all of the words in our word bank. So if we are given the words \"foo\" and \"bar\", then \"foobar\" and \"barfoo\" would be valid substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important detail in the problem description to notice is that all elements in words have the same length. This gives us valuable information about all valid substrings - we know what length they will be. Each valid substring is the concatenation of words.length words which all have the same length, so each valid substring has a length of words.length * words[0].length.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easy for us to take a given index and check if a valid substring starting at this index exists. Let's say that the elements of words have a length of 3. Then, for a given starting index, we can just look at the string in groups of 3 characters and check if those characters form a word in words. Because words can have duplicate words, we should use a hash table to maintain a count for each word. As a bonus, a hash table also lets us search for word matches very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write a helper function that takes an index and returns if a valid substring starting at this index exists. Then, we can build our answer by running this function for all candidate indices. The logic for this function can be something along the lines of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Iterate from the starting index to the starting index plus the size of a valid substring.\n",
    "    Iterate words[0].length characters at a time. At each iteration, we will look at a substring with the same length as the elements in words.\n",
    "    If the substring doesn't exist in words, or it does exist but we already found the necessary amount of it, then return false.\n",
    "    We can use a hash table to keep an updated count of the words between the starting index and the current index.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initialize some variables:\n",
    "        n as the length of s.\n",
    "        k as the length of words\n",
    "        wordLength as the length of each word in words.\n",
    "        substringSize as wordLength * k, which represents the size of each valid substring.\n",
    "        wordCount as a hash table that tracks how many times a word occurs in words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a function check that takes a starting index i and returns if a valid substring starts at index i:\n",
    "        Create a copy of wordCount to make use of for this particular index. Let's call it remaining. Also, initialize an integer wordsUsed which tracks how many matches we have found so far.\n",
    "        Iterate starting from i. Iterate until i + substringSize - we know that each valid substring will have this size, so we don't need to go further. At each iteration, we will be checking for a word - and we know each word has a length of wordLength, so increment by wordLength each time.\n",
    "        If the variable we are iterating with is j, then at each iteration, check for a word sub = s.substring(j, j + wordLength).\n",
    "        If sub is in remaining and has a value greater than 0, then decrease its count by 1 and increase wordsUsed by 1. Otherwise, break out of the loop.\n",
    "        At the end of it all, if wordsUsed == k, that means we used up all the words in words and have found a valid substring. Return true if so, false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now that we have this function check, we can just check all possible starting indices. Because a valid substring has a length of substringSize, we only need to iterate up to n - substringSize. Build an array with all indices that pass check and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 2: Sliding Window\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous approach, we made use of the fact that all elements of words share the same length, which allows us to efficiently check for valid substrings. Unfortunately, we repeated a lot of computation - each character of s is iterated over many times. Imagine if we had an input like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = \"barfoobarfoo\" and words = [\"bar\", \"foo\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid substrings start at index 0, 3, and 6. Notice that the substrings starting at indices 0 and 3 share the same \"foo\". That means we are iterating over and handling this \"foo\" twice, which shouldn't be necessary. We do it again with the substrings starting at indices 3 and 6 - they use the same \"bar\". In this specific example it may not seem too bad, but imagine if we had an input like:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = \"aaaa...aaa\", s.length = 10,000 and words = [\"a\", \"a\", ..., \"a\", \"a\"], words.length = 5000\n",
    "\n",
    "We would be iterating over the same characters millions of times. How can we avoid repeated computation? Let's make use of a sliding window. We can re-use most of the logic from the previous approach, but this time instead of only checking for one valid substring at a time with each call to check, we will try to find all valid substrings in one pass by sliding our window across s.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how will the left and right bounds of the window move, and how can we tell if we our window is a valid substring? Let's say we start at index 0 and do the same process as the previous approach - iterate wordLength at a time, so that at each iteration we are focusing on one potential word. Our iteration variable, say right, can be our right bound. We can initialize our left bound at 0, say left = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, right will move at each iteration, by wordLength each time. At each iteration, we have a word sub = s.substring(right, right + wordLength). If sub is not in words, we know that we cannot possibly form a valid substring, so we should reset the entire window and try again, starting with the next iteration. If sub is in words, then we need to keep track of it. Like in the previous approach, we can use a hash table to keep count of all the words in our current window.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When our window has reached the maximum size (substringSize), we can check if it is a valid substring. Like in the previous approach, we can use an integer wordsUsed to check if wordsUsed == words.length to see if we made use of all the elements in words, and thus have a valid substring. If we do, then we can add left to our answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we have a valid substring or not, if our window has reached maximum size, we need to move the left bound. This means we need to find the word we are removing from the window, and perform the necessary logic to keep our hash table up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note: we may encounter excess words. For example, with s = \"foofoobar\", and words = [\"foo\", \"bar\"], the two \"foo\" should not be matched together to have wordsUsed = 2. Whenever we find that sub is in words, we should check how many times we have seen sub so far in the current window (using our hash table), and if it is greater than the number of times it appears in words (which we can find with a second hash table, wordCount in the first approach), then we know we have an excess word and should not increment wordsUsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, so long as we have an excess word, we can never have a valid substring. Therefore, another criterion for moving our left bound should be to remove words from the left until we find the excess word and remove it (which we can accomplish by comparing the hash table values).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've described the logic needed for the sliding window, how will we apply the window? In the first approach, we tried every candidate index (all indices up until n - substringSize). In this problem, you may notice that starting the process from two indices that are wordLength apart is pointless. For example, if we have words = [\"foo\", \"bar\"], then starting from index 3 is pointless since by starting at index 0, we will move over index 3. However, we will still need to try starting from indices 1 and 2, in case the input looks something like s = \"xfoobar\" or s = \"xyfoobar\". As such, we will only need to perform the sliding window wordLength amount of times.\n",

    "        Iterate using the right bound of our window, right. Start iteration at left, until n, wordLength at a time. At each iteration:\n",
    "            We are dealing with a word sub = s.substring(right, right + wordLength). If sub is not in wordCount, then we must reset the window. Clear our hash table wordsFound, and reset our variables wordsUsed = 0 and excessWord = false. Move left to the next index we will handle, which will be right + wordLength.\n",
    "            Otherwise, if sub is in wordCount, we can continue with our window. First, check if our window is beyond max size or has an excess word. So long as either of these conditions are true, move left over while appropriately updating our hash table, integer and boolean variables.\n",
    "            Now, we can handle sub. Increment its value in wordsFound, and then compare its value in wordsFound to its value in wordCount. If the value is less than or equal, then we can make use of this word in a valid substring - increment wordsUsed. Otherwise, it is an excess word, and we should set excessWord = true.\n",
